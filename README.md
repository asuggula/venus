# Venus

A self-hosted service monitoring tool for growing projects. 

## Description

Venus is a lightweight, self-hosted service monitoring tool that provides customizable, real-time and historical data on critical health metrics of service dependencies.

## Motivation

As architectures shift more towards distributed and cloud based systems, the need for centralized and singular source of truth of end point services has grown in value. While many of these services exist as large packages, Venus aims to give users a flexible suite of baseline statistics on their deployed apps. 


## Features
* Real-time rolling averages on service specific KPIs including Availability, Response Time, Load, and Response Error.
* Service specific KPI threshold settings for quick glance report cards.
* Historic panel data on KPI statistics for Past Hour, Past Day, Past Week, Past Month intervals.
* Real-time dependency graph visualizer that maps service structure and statistics. 
* Server side authentication for secure storage and distribution of analytics.
