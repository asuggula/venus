# Venus

Self-Hosted Service Monitoring

## Description

Venus is a lightweight, self-hosted service monitoring tool that provides customizable, real-time and historical data on critical health metrics of service dependencies.

## Motivation

While many of these services exist as large packages, Venus aims to give users a flexible suite of baseline statistics on their deployed apps.
